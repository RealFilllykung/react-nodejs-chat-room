This is an example for creating a chat room by using React and ExpressJS. We will be using React for frontend development. ExpressJS will be used as a websocket server which will handle and distribute the message to every client that are currently subscribing.

Live demo github pages is not available for this project due to the needs of backend to run and handle message.
